# Degen Gaming Token (DGN)
The Degen Gaming Token (DGN) is a decentralised digital asset established on the Ethereum network that complies with ERC20 standards.

## Description
The Degen Gaming Token (DGN) is an ERC20 token created for gaming platforms that allows users to exchange tokens for unique in-game items and receive in-game prizes. The coin enables a decentralised and open gaming ecosystem where players can be rewarded for their participation and gaming prowess. The contract provides functionality for minting, transferring, burning, and redeeming, enabling the platform owner to give players additional tokens in exchange for their participation and giving players the option to exchange, utilise, or redeem their acquired tokens.

## Getting Started
Installing
You can download or clone the repository containing the smart contract code in order to use the Degen Gaming Token contract.

### Executing Program
- Launch the DegenToken.sol smart contract file in a Solidity development environment, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

- Check the contract's compilation to make sure there are no mistakes.

- Use your preferred deployment tool to deploy the contract on the Avalanche Fuji Testnet (or other supported networks).

- After deployment, make a note of the contract's contact information.

### Interacting with the Contract
- After the Degen Gaming Token contract is set up, there are several ways to communicate with it:
- Minting New Tokens: Only Syed Waheedulla, the contract's owner, has the authority to issue new tokens. Call the mint function, passing as parameters the number of tokens to be minted and the address of the intended receiver. The new tokens generated by this function will be distributed to the given address.
- Transferring Tokens: By using the transfer function, token holders can move their tokens to different addresses. This function accepts two arguments: the recipient's address and the number of tokens to be sent.
- Token holders have the option of burning their own tokens if they no longer require them. Use the burn function and the input number of tokens to burn. The sender's balance will no longer contain the tokens.
- Redeeming Tokens: Token holders can exchange their tokens for in-game goods or rewards by invoking the redeem function and passing an argument with the number of tokens they wish to exchange. From the sender's balance, the function will burn the specified number of tokens.
- Checking the Token Balance: Call the checkBalance function with the address as an argument to check the token balance of any address. This function returns the address's current balance.
